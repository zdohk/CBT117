//***FILE 117 IS A SERIES OF WTO EXITS FROM JAMES COOK OF COCA      *   FILE 117
//*           COLA IN ATLANTA GEORGIA                               *   FILE 117
//*                                                                 *   FILE 117
//*           USING THE "MESSAGE PROCESSING FACILITY"               *   FILE 117
//*             OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "MANY WTO EXITS"                 *   FILE 117
//*                                                                 *   FILE 117
//*      ENCLOSED ARE SEVERAL WTO EXITS WRITTEN ACCORDING TO        *   FILE 117
//*      THE STANDARDS OF THE "MESSAGE PROCESSING FACILITY"         *   FILE 117
//*      UNDER MVS/SP2.1.2.  THESE EXITS HAVE REPLACED "R2D2"       *   FILE 117
//*      FROM THE CBT TAPE.  OTHER FEATURES OF "R2D2" ARE NOT       *   FILE 117
//*      USED AT OUR CENTER.  NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO RUN UNDER       *   FILE 117
//*      MVS/SP2.1.3.                                               *   FILE 117
//*                                                                 *   FILE 117
//*      THE EXITS MUST BE ASSEMBLED AS "RENT,NOALIGN" AND          *   FILE 117
//*      LINK-EDITED WITH THE OPTIONS "RENT,REUS" INTO THE LINK     *   FILE 117
//*      LIST.  THE "MPFLSTXX" MUST BE IN SYS1.PARMLIB AND AN       *   FILE 117
//*      ENTRY MADE IN "IEASYSXX".                                  *   FILE 117
//*                                                                 *   FILE 117
//*      THESE EXITS CAN ABEND ANYWHERE AND NOT CAUSE ANY           *   FILE 117
//*      PROBLEMS.  THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE NOTICED IN         *   FILE 117
//*      IMPLEMENTING ANY MPF EXIT IS THAT THE IEZMGCR MACRO        *   FILE 117
//*      FROM IBM MUST HAVE AN "ORG" IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT TO        *   FILE 117
//*      PREVENT PROBLEMS.                                          *   FILE 117
//*                                                                 *   FILE 117
//*      IF "IEAVMXIT" IS LINKED INTO THE LINKLIST, IT WILL BE      *   FILE 117
//*      USED.  IT NEEDS NO ENTRY IN "MPFLSTXX".                    *   FILE 117
//*                                                                 *   FILE 117
//*      MOST OF THE EXITS ARE SELF-EXPLANATORY.  THE ONES THAT     *   FILE 117

//*      THE MESSAGE IS "TAPE XXXXXX MAY STILL BE ON DRIVE          *   FILE 117
//*      XXX".  THIS WAS DESIGNED FOR THE IBM 3480 TAPE DRIVE       *   FILE 117
//*      WITH THE TAPE STACKER FEATURE BECAUSE IT CAN HOLD SIX      *   FILE 117
//*      "USED" TAPES PER DRIVE.  IN OUR SHOP, THAT WORKS OUT       *   FILE 117
